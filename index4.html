	<p> In Janurary of 2016, the infamous band <strong>One Direction</strong> decided to go on a <em>permanent hiatus</em> for the better good. Soon enought Harry released his <em>first solo song / first single</em> <strong>"Sign of the Times"</strong> (released in 2017.) In the United States <strong>alone,</strong> Sign of the Times has debuted number four on the <strong>Billboard Hot 100.</strong> Within its first week of being released, it sold <em>142,000 copies by store, even more digitaly, and earned 16.5 million streams and 23 million airplays all within the first week. </em> Harry admitted in an interview that the reason he released Sign of the Times rather the other songs on his album that were also written and ready to be released is because he wanted to divert from the classical <strong>One Direction</strong> type music. </p>
