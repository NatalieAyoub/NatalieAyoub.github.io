        <p> Lets talk more about <strong>Watermelon Sugar,</strong> its sucseess and the story behind it. Harry originally wrote <strong>Watermelon Sugar</strong> while on tour <strong>"Live On Tour".</strong> Harry has admitted that it was the hardest song he has ever written because it took him around <em>a year</em> to finish it. He kept rewritting it but could not figure out an ending that he was <em>pleased</em> with and even revealed that he kept taking it in an out of the album because he was so unsure of it. Even after almost three years of the song being released, the song places <strong>20th</strong> of the <strong>US Billboard Hot 100,</strong> <strong>33rd</strong> on <strong>S Adult Contemporary Billboard, 11th</strong> on <strong>US Adult Top 40 Billboard, 11th</strong> on <strong>US Dance/Mix Show Airplay Billboard</strong>in the US <em>alone,</em> and has over <strong>one billion streams</strong> on <strong>Spotify</strong> alone. </p>
