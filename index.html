    <h1>What Are My Hobbies?</h1>
    <p>In my free time I love to dance. I have been dancing since I was two years old and have never gotten rid of my passion for it. At first I begun ballet for two years until I finally realized that it wasn't my thing and my obsession for hiphop finally begun. Since then i have been dancing almost every single day of my life and I dont plan on stopping anytime soon. I don't have much intrests other than any types of art. I love to paint, draw, listen to music and everything that has to do with them. I might not know the most about sports but I definitly have my favorite teams. For football I live for Manchester United, for American Football I love the Green Bay Packers, and for basketball I like the Golden State Worriors. </p>
