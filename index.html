	<H4> Harry Styles in school </H4>
	<p> Harry went to "Homles Chapel Compehensive School and Sixth Form College". In Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, England, Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School is a co-educational secondary school and sixth form centre. Harry admited to not being the best student but pushed through college then eventually dropped his schooling to focus on his music. Harry Styles was a good student, although he didn't get particularly good scores. Gemma, Harry's older sister, says that she was more studious and that it was difficult for Harry to follow in her footsteps. Harry was a chatty and obnoxious student. His mother helped him with his homework and studying, but he still became apprehensive before big exams. Harry's sister established a high academic standard for him to achieve. When Harry couldn't get the same grades as her, Gemma feels he became frustrated. </p>
